      <h1>Review Policy</h1>
      <p>Effective date: February 13, 2026</p>

      <p>We want BajaDentalGuide reviews to be useful, fair, and trustworthy.</p>

      <h2>What we publish</h2>
      <p>
        We publish both positive and negative reviews, as long as they follow this policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not allow clinics to pay to remove reviews. We do not remove a review simply because
        it is negative.
      </p>

      <h2>Who can leave a review</h2>
      <p>
        You should only leave a review if it reflects your genuine experience (or the experience of
        someone you accompanied) with the clinic.
      </p>

      <h2>What to include</h2>
      <p>Helpful reviews often include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>what procedure(s) you received (optional)</li>
        <li>how communication and scheduling went</li>
        <li>what you liked and what you didn’t</li>
        <li>what you wish you had known beforehand</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What you must not include</h2>
      <p>Do not include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          private personal information about staff or other patients (addresses, personal phone
          numbers, IDs, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>medical information about other people without their consent</li>
        <li>threats, hate speech, harassment, or discriminatory content</li>
        <li>spam, promotional content, or links intended to manipulate search rankings</li>
        <li>instructions or content intended to facilitate wrongdoing</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conflicts of interest and incentives</h2>
      <p>
        If you have a relationship with a clinic (employee, owner, marketing agency, family member,
        competitor), you must disclose it, and your review may be rejected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do not submit reviews in exchange for compensation or incentives. If we ever allow
        incentivized reviews for a specific program, they must be clearly disclosed and labeled.
      </p>

      <h2>Moderation process</h2>
      <p>
        Reviews may be held for moderation before publication. We may reject reviews that violate
        this policy or appear to be inauthentic.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may edit reviews for formatting or to remove disallowed private information, but we will
        not edit reviews to change their meaning.
      </p>

      <h2>Reporting issues</h2>
      <p>To report a review that violates this policy, contact support@bajadentalguide.com</p>
      <p>
        and include the clinic page URL and the review text or screenshot.
