      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Effective date: February 13, 2026</p>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how BajaDentalGuide (“we”, “us”) collects, uses, and shares
        information when you use our website.
      </p>

      <h2>What we collect</h2>
      <p>1) Session cookie (bdg_session)</p>
      <p>
        We use a session cookie to help the site function, including features like saving clinics to
        your shortlist and understanding aggregate usage patterns.
      </p>

      <p>2) Usage events (analytics we record ourselves)</p>
      <p>When you use the site, we may record events such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>saving/removing a clinic from your shortlist</li>
        <li>clicking outbound links (website / WhatsApp / third‑party listings)</li>
        <li>submitting a review</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These events help us understand what’s useful and prevent abuse.</p>

      <p>3) Email address (optional)</p>
      <p>
        If you enter your email to receive reminders or follow‑ups, we store your email and opt‑in
        status.
      </p>

      <p>4) Reviews you submit</p>
      <p>
        If you submit a review, we store the information you provide (for example: rating, written
        feedback, optional procedure and visit date fields).
      </p>

      <h2>How we use information</h2>
      <p>We use collected information to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>operate and maintain the site</li>
        <li>provide shortlist functionality</li>
        <li>send opt‑in reminders/follow‑ups (if you provide email consent)</li>
        <li>moderate and publish reviews consistent with our Review Policy</li>
        <li>improve site reliability, security, and user experience</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Email preferences and unsubscribe</h2>
      <p>
        If you opt in to emails, you can unsubscribe using the unsubscribe link included in our
        emails. Once unsubscribed, we will stop sending further reminder/follow‑up emails for that
        session profile.
      </p>

      <h2>How we share information</h2>
      <p>We do not sell your personal information.</p>
      <p>
        We may share information with service providers that help us run the site (for example
        hosting, databases, and email delivery). These providers are authorized to process data only
        as needed to provide services to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also disclose information if required by law or to protect the security and integrity
        of the site.
      </p>

      <h2>Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        We keep information only as long as necessary to operate the service, comply with legal
        obligations, and prevent abuse. We may retain aggregated or de‑identified analytics longer.
      </p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        No website can guarantee absolute security, but we use reasonable technical and
        organizational measures to protect information.
      </p>

      <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
      <p>
        BajaDentalGuide is not intended for children under 13. If you believe a child has provided
        personal information, contact us so we can address it.
