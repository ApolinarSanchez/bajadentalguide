      <h1>Rating Methodology</h1>
      <p>Effective date: February 13, 2026</p>

      <h2>What the BDG rating represents</h2>
      <p>
        A clinic’s BDG rating is the average of the overall star ratings from published
        BajaDentalGuide reviews for that clinic.
      </p>
      <p>
        We show the number of published BDG reviews alongside the average. A rating based on a small
        number of reviews is less reliable than a rating based on many reviews.
      </p>

      <h2>What the BDG rating does not represent</h2>
      <p>
        BDG ratings do not incorporate third‑party ratings (such as Google or Yelp). We may link to
        third‑party listings for convenience, but we do not import or blend third‑party review text
        or star ratings into BDG scores.
      </p>

      <h2>What reviews are counted</h2>
      <p>
        Only reviews with status Published are included in the displayed average. Pending or rejected
        reviews are not included.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to methodology</h2>
      <p>
        If we change how ratings are calculated or displayed, we will update this page and the
        effective date.
      </p>

      <h2>Data sources</h2>
      <p>
        Our clinics directory is sourced from INEGI&apos;s Directorio Estadístico Nacional de
        Unidades Económicas (DENUE), then normalized for use in BajaDentalGuide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outbound links may send you to third-party destinations such as Google Maps or Yelp. We do
        not copy third-party review text or ratings into BDG.
