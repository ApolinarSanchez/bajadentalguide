      <h1>About BajaDentalGuide</h1>

      <p>
        BajaDentalGuide helps people discover and compare dental clinics in Tijuana and the
        surrounding area.
      </p>

      <p>We focus on the practical questions that matter for cross‑border care:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>How to find clinics by neighborhood and procedure</li>
        <li>How to contact clinics quickly (website / WhatsApp / listings)</li>
        <li>
          What real patients say about their experiences on BajaDentalGuide (BDG)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What we are</h2>
      <p>
        BajaDentalGuide is a discovery hub plus a first‑party review platform. We list clinics and
        provide tools to help you compare options, save a shortlist, and (optionally) get reminders
        to share outcomes.
      </p>

      <h2>What we are not</h2>
      <p>
        BajaDentalGuide does not provide medical advice. We do not diagnose conditions or recommend
        treatment. Always consult a qualified dental professional.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also are not affiliated with any clinic listed on the site unless clearly stated.
      </p>

      <h2>How BDG reviews work</h2>
      <p>BDG reviews are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Submitted by users</li>
        <li>Moderated for policy violations (spam, harassment, private info, etc.)</li>
        <li>
          Published whether they are positive or negative, as long as they follow our rules
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        BDG ratings shown on clinic pages are based only on published BDG reviews (not Google, Yelp,
        or other third‑party ratings).
      </p>

      <h2>External links</h2>
      <p>Clinic profile pages may include links to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clinic websites</li>
        <li>WhatsApp contact links</li>
        <li>Third‑party listings (e.g., Google or Yelp)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These links are provided for convenience. You are responsible for confirming details directly
        with the clinic.
      </p>
